        <div>

          <p class="article-text">As markets continue to shift, American small businesses remain focused on growing
            their businesses this
            year.
            Though, while small businesses (with 19 or fewer employees) are hiring according to recent data from the
            ADP
            National Employment Report, they are still faced with challenges when growing their business. In fact, in
            a recent
            ADP Market Pulse Study, one-third of small businesses surveyed cited growing their business as a top
            challenge
            they’re currently facing – a challenge that can be examined through four key trends. These trends
            impacting small
            business include finding and retaining workers, staying in compliance with changing laws and regulations,
            navigating
            economic change and leveraging emerging technologies. Let’s dig into these trends further.</p>

          <h2 class="article-text">Talent: Recruitment, Retention and Employee Engagement</h2>

          <p>Even in a tight labor market, small businesses still have strong hiring plans, according to ADP’s recent
            Market
            Pulse Study. While 39 percent of small businesses surveyed have paused or plan to pause hiring, fifty-two
            percent
            are not planning to pause hiring. Additionally, 22 percent plan to increase employee wages in the next
            three
            months.
          </p>
          <p>To attract and retain talent, a powerful tool for small business owners is to mine HCM data to pay
            workers a
            competitive wage and offer the kind of benefits they want. Compensation benchmarking is a data-driven
            process of
            determining how much to pay an employee based on what competitors in the area are paying people in similar
            roles,
            taking into account geographic region, industry, business size, cost of living, job responsibilities,
            candidate
            education, and candidate skills and credentials. This data can help give small business owners the job
            market
            intelligence they need to compete with other businesses, even larger businesses.</p>
          <p>This data can also help small businesses tailor their benefits to their employees’ needs. You don’t have
            to be a
            large company to offer a variety of benefits. HR outsourcing, specifically professional employer
            organizations
            (PEO), for example, can provide access to more plan choices at competitive pricing. Employees can enroll
            online
            using state-of-the-art self-service technology. More benefits, better pricing and easy access can help
            small
            business owners recruit and retain good people.</p>
          <p>ADP’s recent Market Pulse Study found 44% of small businesses surveyed are focusing on training and
            skills
            development as a top workforce priority. This includes upskilling and reskilling to ensure their people
            are
            equipped
            to navigate new demands and technologies. In a small business, career paths often look much different than
            the
            ladder many envision in larger companies. But small businesses still have opportunities to help develop
            their
            workforce; they just may look different, focusing on lateral movement and skill-building through stretch
            assignments. Paying attention to employee development can help small businesses drive employee engagement
            and
            ultimately higher employee retention.</p>

          <h2 class="article-text">Compliance: Keeping Up with Changing Labor Laws</h2>

          <p>Amid a continuously changing regulatory landscape, small
            businesses can fall behind, especially if their employees are in more than one geographic location. In the
            past 12
            months alone, there were over 200 HR, payroll and tax compliance changes, from paid sick leave to pay
            transparency.
            With more local and state governments passing pay
            transparency laws, for instance, organizations must be sure that their compensation approach is
            compliant and based on valid data. Employing a data-driven approach can inform a pay audit, helping to
            achieve
            compliance and keep pay competitive.</p>
          <p>Leveraging HCM technology and partner expertise can help HR stay on top of potential compliance changes
            or
            issues.
            For example, this past April the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) released a final
            rule
            which updated and revised the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) exempting executive,
            administrative
            and professional employees from minimum wage and overtime requirements. This means employers must review
            the
            salary
            amounts paid to any employees are currently treated exempt and determine if their compensation is
            sufficient to
            meet
            the new rule. Data-driven HCM technology can not only provide this information but offer streamlined
            methods for
            budgeting and making the necessary changes.</p>

          <h2 class="article-text">Tax Credits: Navigating a Changing Economic Environment</h2>

          <p>Often, small business owners are the first to feel the impact of economic changes, like wages and
            inflation, but
            driving healthy cash flow through programs like available
            tax credits can help.</p>
          <p>If your organization is growing, training, relocating, investing in facilities or consolidating, you may
            be
            eligible to take advantage of a variety of federal, state and local tax credits and incentives. There are
            many tax
            credit programs available that small businesses might not be aware of or have guidance on how to leverage.
            For
            example:</p>

          <p>Accountant and HR advisory partners as well as HCM technology can help small businesses identify and
            execute on
            tax
            credits they might be eligible for, helping them capture incentives for their growing business.</p>

          <h2 class="article-text">Technology: Driving Efficiency</h2>

          <p>Many small businesses are also leveraging new technologies to help drive efficiencies. They are focused
            on
            reducing
            their tech stack and looking for opportunities to consolidate and consumerize the tools they provide their
            employees.
            Through embedded solutions and integrations, they can curate a tailored ecosystem to manage their business
            and
            people in a way that’s personalized to their specific needs.</p>
          <p>Using data and embracing new technologies like AI is enabling small business owners to take advantage of
            automation, freeing up time on administrative tasks and giving more time to focus on tasks that support
            business
            objectives and growth.</p>
          <p>Technology can help create efficiencies in HR too, like streamlining tasks, validating payroll
            information,
            helping
            to prevent errors from manual data entry, and improving operations. For example, time and attendance
            solutions can
            better manage overtime or catch errors before they become a major problem.</p>
          <p>Partnering with experts or managed service providers can alleviate the challenge of implementing and
            maintaining
            these technologies, helping small business owners stay focused on strategy and business growth.</p>
          <p>No one knows for sure what the next year will bring but these trends can present opportunities for small
            businesses
            to drive growth by leveraging technology to hire, provide competitive benefits, streamline processes and
            foster a
            more satisfying work environment for employees.</p>
